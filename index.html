      <h4 class="section-title" id="section1">Biography</h4>
             <p> <strong>Rigoberta Menchú was born on January 9, 1959 to a poor Indian peasant family </strong> and raised in the Quiche branch of the Mayan culture. In her early years she helped with the family farm work, either in the northern highlands where
          her family lived, or on the Pacific coast, where both adults and children went to pick coffee on the big plantations.</p>
        <p> Rigoberta Menchú soon became involved in social reform activities through the Catholic Church, and became prominent in the women's rights movement when still only a teenager. Such reform work aroused considerable opposition in influential circles,
          especially after a guerilla organization established itself in the area. The Menchú family was accused of taking part in guerrilla activities and Rigoberta's father, Vicente, was imprisoned and tortured for allegedly having participated in the
          execution of a local plantation owner. After his release, he joined the recently founded <strong>Committee of the Peasant Union (CUC).</strong></p>

          <p>In <strong>1979</strong>, Rigoberta, too, joined the CUC. That year her brother was arrested, tortured and killed by the army. The following year, her father was killed when security forces in the capital stormed the Spanish Embassy where he and
          some other peasants were staying. Shortly afterwards, her mother also died after having been arrested, tortured and raped. Rigoberta became increasingly active in the CUC, and taught herself Spanish as well as other Mayan languages than her
          native Quiche. In 1980, she figured prominently in a strike the CUC organized for better conditions for farm workers on the Pacific coast, and on May 1, 1981, she was active in large demonstrations in the capital. She joined the radical 31st
          of January Popular Front, in which her contribution chiefly consisted of educating the Indian peasant population in resistance to massive military oppression.</p>

        <p>In <strong>1981</strong>, Rigoberta Menchú had to go into hiding in Guatemala, and then flee to Mexico. That marked the beginning of a new phase in her life: as the organizer abroad of resistance to oppression in Guatemala and the struggle for
          Indian peasant peoples' rights. In 1982, she took part in the founding of the joint opposition body, The United Representation of the Guatemalan Opposition (RUOG).
          <p>In <strong>1983</strong>, she told her life story to Elisabeth Burgos Debray. The resulting book, called in English, <strong>I, Rigoberta Menchú</strong>, is a gripping human document which attracted considerable international attention. </p>
          <p>In <strong>1986</strong>, Rigoberta Menchú became a member of the National Coordinating Committee of the CUC, and the following year she performed as the narrator in a powerful film called <strong>When the Mountains Tremble</strong>, about the struggles and sufferings of the Maya people.</p>

          <p>Over the years, Rigoberta Menchú has become widely known as a <strong>leading advocate of Indian rights and ethno-cultural reconciliation</strong>, not only in Guatemala but in the Western Hemisphere generally, and her work has earned her several
            international awards, including the <strong>Nobel Peace Prize in 1992</strong> and the <strong>Prince of Asturias Award in 1998</strong>.</p>

       <blockquote> "<strong>We are not myths of the past, ruins in the jungle, or zoos</strong>. We are people and we want to be respected, not to be victims of intolerance and racism."
       </blockquote>
       <blockquote> "This is why Indians are thought to be stupid. They can't think, they don't know anything, they say. But <strong>we have hidden our identity because we needed to resist</strong>, we wanted to protect what governments have wanted to take away from us."

              "<strong>I am like a drop of water on a rock</strong>. After drip, drip, dripping in the same place, I begin to leave a mark, and I leave my mark in many people's hearts."
